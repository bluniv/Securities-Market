### 1.Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV analysis is used to help determine how much an investment, project, or any series of cash flows is worth. It is an all-encompassing metric, as it takes into account all revenues, expenses, and capital costs associated with an investment in its Free Cash Flow (FCF).

In addition to factoring all revenues and costs, it also takes into account the timing of each cash flow that can result in a large impact on the present value of an investment. For example, it’s better to see cash inflows sooner and cash outflows later, compared to the opposite.

In theory, an NPV is “good” if it is greater than zero

### 2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The internal rate of return (IRR) is a metric used in financial analysis to estimate the profitability of potential investments. 
It is the annual rate of growth that an investment is expected to generate.
IRR is calculated using the same concept as net present value (NPV), except it sets the NPV equal to zero.
